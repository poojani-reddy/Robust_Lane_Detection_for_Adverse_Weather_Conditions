# A Resilient Vision-Based Lane Detection System for All-Weather Autonomous Driving

## 📌 Project Overview

Lane detection is a critical component in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving. Reliable lane detection enables safe navigation and supports features like Lane Keep Assistance and Adaptive Cruise Control.

Real-world challenges such as rain, fog, night driving, glare, shadows, and faded lane markings make traditional lane detection unreliable.

This project proposes a robust, adaptive, and real-time lane detection system capable of performing consistently across diverse weather and lighting conditions.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Human error is a leading cause of road accidents. Autonomous systems require highly reliable lane detection, but existing approaches:

- Fail in poor weather and low-light conditions  
- Use static thresholds  
- Use fixed ROI (Region of Interest)  
- Lack temporal continuity across frames  

This project introduces an adaptive and resilient lane detection framework to overcome these limitations.

---

## 🚀 Proposed Solution

The system integrates multiple computer vision techniques with adaptive tuning:

- Bilateral Filtering – Noise reduction while preserving edges  
- Canny Edge Detection – Extract lane edges  
- Fuzzy Logic Controller – Dynamically adjusts Canny thresholds  
- Adaptive ROI Selection – Focuses only on road region  
- Hough Transform – Detects lane line geometry  
- Temporal Tracking – Maintains continuity across video frames

## 🧠 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Preprocessing
Removes noise using Bilateral Filtering while preserving lane edge details.

### 2️⃣ Adaptive Edge Detection
Uses Canny Edge Detection.  
A Fuzzy Logic Controller dynamically tunes threshold values based on lighting and weather conditions.

### 3️⃣ Region of Interest (ROI)
Dynamically selects only the road area.  
Reduces false detections and improves computational efficiency.

### 4️⃣ Lane Line Detection
Uses Hough Transform to detect lane boundaries.  
Supports mild curves using curve fitting techniques.

### 5️⃣ Temporal Tracking
Uses previous frame information to maintain lane continuity.  
Handles:
- Temporary occlusion  
- Faded lanes  
- Shadows  
- Glare
